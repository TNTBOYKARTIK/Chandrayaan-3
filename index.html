            <b>The history of the Chandrayaan programme:</b> The Chandrayaan programme is India's first lunar exploration programme. It was launched in 2008 with the goal of studying the moon's surface and subsurface. The first mission in the programme, Chandrayaan-1, was launched in 2008. It was a successful mission that made a number of important discoveries about the moon. The second mission in the programme, Chandrayaan-2, was launched in 2019. It was also a successful mission, but it did not land on the moon as planned. Chandrayaan-3 is the third and most recent mission in the programme. <br><br>
            <b>The technical challenges of landing a spacecraft on the moon:</b> Landing a spacecraft on the moon is a very challenging task. The moon has no atmosphere, so there is no air resistance to slow down the spacecraft. This means that the spacecraft must have a very powerful rocket engine to slow itself down enough to land safely. The moon also has a very rough surface, so the spacecraft must be able to withstand a lot of impact. <br><br>
            <b>The scientific discoveries that Chandrayaan 3 could make:</b> Chandrayaan 3 could make a number of important scientific discoveries about the moon. It could study the lunar surface and subsurface in more detail than ever before. It could also investigate the history of water on the moon. This is important because water is essential for life, and it could be a potential resource for future human exploration of the moon. Chandrayaan 3 could also search for potential resources on the moon, such as metals and minerals. <br><br>
            <b>The benefits of India's lunar exploration program:</b> India's lunar exploration program has a number of benefits. It helps to improve India's space technology and scientific capabilities. It also helps to promote India's soft power and image as a global leader in space exploration. The program also has the potential to generate new economic opportunities for India, such as in the mining and tourism sectors. <br><br>
           
            <b>In December 2019, it was reported that ISRO requested the initial funding of the project, amounting to ₹75 crore (US$9.4 million), out of which ₹60 crore (US$7.5 million) will be for meeting expenditure towards machinery, equipment and other capital expenditure, while the remaining ₹15 crore (US$1.9 million) is sought under revenue expenditure head.</b><br><br>
            <u><b>Confirming the existence of the project, ISRO's former chairman K. Sivan stated that the estimated cost would be around ₹615 crore (equivalent to ₹721 crore or US$90 million in 2023).</b></u>
